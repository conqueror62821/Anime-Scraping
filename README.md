# This Repo is deprecated and doesn't work anymore. I don't plan on updating it anymore. Reasons are simple :-
**1.This was created as a side project and didn't have much plans with it but still thank you for giving this project support** <br>
**2. The Reasons for shutting it down is simple, It's Illegal to pirate even if you are scraping from another website like gogoanime** <br>
**3. This project was supposed to be a personal website to watch anime for me and my friends thats why it had literally no ads** <br>
**4. As there were no ads we didnt had any income to keep up the servers and we aren't rich. ** <br>
**In the end thanks for supporting this project and i know that it stopped working a long time ago but im shutting it down right now finally** <br>

**The tutorial of installing and all other stuff will stay in this readme just in case some angel comes and plans on reviving this project** <br>

**I prefer you use other website like zoro.to or gogoanime but still you got ads **
